Hi, I'm Janelle Carlos!
I'm currently studying electrical engineering on the EP track.
I chose my major because I enjoy learning about electrical systems work and how they are applied in real-world systems.
A fun fact about me is:  I was born on Leap Year Day (February 29th)
What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I want to learn more programming languages.
A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Spark of the Everflame by Penn Cole
